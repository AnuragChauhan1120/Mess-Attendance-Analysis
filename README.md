This project focuses on understanding the attendance patterns in college mess facilities across an entire semester. A synthetic dataset was created to simulate real-world student attendance behavior, 
accounting for factors like:
1.Weekdays vs. Weekends
2.Exam periods
3.Special events / holidays
4.Seasonal variations

Using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Power BI visualizations, this project reveals insights that can help in optimizing food supply, reducing waste, and improving mess management decisions.
